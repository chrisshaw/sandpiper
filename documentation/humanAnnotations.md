# Human Annotations

## Overview

**Human Annotations** allow you to upload manually coded labels into Sandpiper, creating **Human Runs** that can be directly compared against LLM runs in an **Evaluation**. This is essential for measuring the accuracy of LLM annotations against a human gold standard.

When you upload a CSV of human annotations, Sandpiper validates the data, matches it to the sessions in your **Run Set**, and creates one human run per annotator. These human runs then appear alongside LLM runs in the evaluation, enabling calculation of **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1**, and **Cohen's Kappa** between human and LLM annotators.

## How to use

### Downloading the Annotation Template

1.  **Open a Run Set:** Navigate to the **Run Set** where you want to add human labels.
2.  **Download Template:** From the Run Set dropdown menu, click **"Download Annotation Template"**. You can configure how many annotator slots to include per field before generating the CSV (see the definition of a **slot** below).
3.  **Review the Template:** The generated CSV includes these columns:
    - `session_id` — the session identifier
    - `sequence_id` — the position of the utterance within the session
    - `role` — the speaker role (e.g. Tutor, Student)
    - `content` — the utterance text
    - One annotation column per **annotator**, per **field**, per **slot**, using the naming format `annotator[<name>][<slot>]<fieldKey>` (for example, `annotator[joe][0]TUTOR_MOVE`). Each part of the name means:
      - **`<name>`** — the annotator's name (e.g. `joe`). Each distinct name becomes its own Human Run. This is the only identifier of _who did the coding_ — it is **not** tied to a tutor or student.
      - **`<slot>`** — a zero-based index (`0`, `1`, `2`, …) that lets a **single annotator record more than one value for the same field on the same utterance**. You choose how many slots each field gets when downloading the template; a field with 2 slots produces `annotator[joe][0]TUTOR_MOVE` and `annotator[joe][1]TUTOR_MOVE`. **A slot is _not_ a tutor ID** — speakers are identified by the `role` column, and each utterance by `session_id` + `sequence_id`. Most coding uses only slot `0`; extra slots exist for multi-label fields where one utterance can carry more than one code.
      - **`<fieldKey>`** — the `fieldKey` of a field defined in your **[Prompt Schema](schema)**. Every field in the schema generates its own annotation column(s) here, and the values you enter should be that field's schema codes (e.g. `PRAISE`, `NOT_PRAISE`). Change a field in the schema and the template's columns change with it.

#### Sample template

A template for annotator `joe` coding one field, `TUTOR_MOVE`, with **2 slots** looks like this:

| session_id | sequence_id | role    | content                                        | annotator[joe][0]TUTOR_MOVE | annotator[joe][1]TUTOR_MOVE |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| sess_001   | 0           | Tutor   | Let's pick up where we left off on question 3. | MANAGING                    |                             |
| sess_001   | 1           | Student | Okay… I don't really get part b.               |                             |                             |
| sess_001   | 2           | Tutor   | What do you notice about the denominator here? | PROBING_UNDERSTAND          | GIVING_HINT                 |
| sess_001   | 3           | Student | Oh — they have to match first.                 |                             |                             |

- `session_id`, `sequence_id`, `role`, and `content` are pre-filled by the template — leave them unchanged so each row still matches the run set.
- Fill the `annotator[...]` columns with codes from that field's schema; leave a cell blank when no code applies.
- Here `joe` gives one utterance two codes (`PROBING_UNDERSTAND` + `GIVING_HINT`) using slots `0` and `1`; every other row uses only slot `0`.
- Adding a second annotator (`josephine`) would add a parallel set of columns: `annotator[josephine][0]TUTOR_MOVE`, etc. — and create a second Human Run.

### Annotating the CSV

1.  **Fill in Labels:** Open the CSV in a spreadsheet editor and fill in the annotator columns with your human labels.
2.  **Multiple Annotators:** Each unique annotator name in the column headers becomes its own human run. Sandpiper detects annotators automatically from the `annotator[<name>][<slot>]<field>` format.
3.  **Match Schema Codes:** Each column's `<fieldKey>` corresponds to a field in your **[Prompt Schema](schema)**, and the values you enter should match that field's codes (e.g., `PRAISE`, `NOT_PRAISE`). Sandpiper accepts any string value, but codes that don't match the schema won't align with LLM runs during evaluation.

### Uploading the CSV

1.  **Open the Upload Dialog:** From the **Run Set** dropdown menu, click **"Upload Human Annotations"**.
2.  **Select the CSV:** Choose your completed CSV file. Sandpiper analyzes it and displays a validation summary:
    - **Annotators** — the annotators detected from column headers, and how many runs will be created
    - **Annotation Fields** — the fields that will be imported
    - **Matched sessions** — sessions in the CSV that match a session in the run set
    - **Unmatched sessions** — session IDs in the CSV that don't match any run set session
    - **Missing sessions** — sessions in the run set that aren't covered by the CSV
3.  **Confirm Upload:** Review the analysis results and confirm the upload to create the human runs.
4.  **Processing:** Sandpiper processes the annotations in the background and adds the human runs to the run set. Each human annotation is stored with `identifiedBy: "HUMAN"` to distinguish it from LLM-generated annotations.

### Using Human Runs in Evaluations

Once human runs are added to a run set:

1.  **Create an Evaluation:** From the **Evaluation** tab, create a new evaluation that includes both human and LLM runs.
2.  **Set Human Run as Base:** Select a human run as the **Base Run** to calculate accuracy metrics (Precision, Recall, F1) for all other runs.
3.  **Compare Results:** The evaluation will show agreement scores between all run pairs, with human labels serving as ground truth.
